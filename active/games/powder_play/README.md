# Powder Playground

Desktop-first falling-sand / powder game.

This project is a prototype for playing with user-generated materials produced by a local LLM. The initial MVP implements a TypeScript + Vite frontend, a worker-based simulator, a JSON-based Material Behavior Language (MBL), and an offline validation harness.

See `docs/material-schema.md` for the material schema and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for development notes.
