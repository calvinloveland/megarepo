### #3 [bug] Epson ET-2850 scanner not detected
Summary:
- Epson ET-2850 remains invisible to SANE/NAPS2 even after enabling epkowa, epsonscan2, airscan, and custom dll.conf overrides.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Plug the Epson ET-2850 (USB id 04b8:118b) into 1337book.
2. Run `scanimage -L`.
3. Optionally run `SANE_DEBUG_DLL=1 scanimage -L` and `sane-find-scanner`.

Expected Result:
- `scanimage -L` lists the ET-2850 via epkowa or epsonscan2 and NAPS2 can start a scan.

Actual Result:
- Only the laptop cameras show up (`v4l:/dev/video*`).
- `SANE_DEBUG_DLL=1` never logs epkowa/epsonscan2 being loaded.
- `sane-find-scanner` reports "Access denied (insufficient permissions)" for the Epson device even after adding the user to the scanner group and re-logging.

Additional Context:
- `lsusb` confirms the printer/scanner is attached: `04b8:118b Seiko Epson Corp. ET-2850`.
- Config changes already made: enable SANE, add epkowa/epsonscan2 + udev rules, override `sane.d/dll.conf`, force `SANE_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/sane.d:/run/current-system/sw/etc/sane.d`.
- Latest quick tests + `./rebuild.sh` completed successfully, so this seems isolated to runtime detection rather than build failures.
