# Full Auto CI

Fully automatic Continuous Integration.
Pulls down the latest code, runs tests, and reports results.
Works in the background on every commit to provide a history of results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/full_auto_ci.git
cd full_auto_ci
pip install -e .
```

For API and dashboard features:

```bash
pip install -e ".[api,dashboard]"
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Configuration

The system uses a YAML configuration file. By default, it looks for a config file at `~/.fullautoci/config.yml`.

You can copy and modify the example configuration:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.fullautoci
cp config.example.yml ~/.fullautoci/config.yml
```

### Tool settings

Test tooling is driven by the `tools` section. Each tool can be disabled or tuned without code changes:

```yaml
tools:
	coverage:
		enabled: true
		run_tests_cmd: ["pytest"]  # override to customize the test runner
		timeout_seconds: 300        # abort the coverage run command after 5 minutes
		xml_timeout_seconds: 120    # abort `coverage xml` if report generation stalls
		ratchet:
			enabled: true
			target: 90.0              # require at least 90% line coverage eventually
			tolerance: 0.1            # (optional) allow small float variance
	lizard:
		enabled: true
		max_ccn: 10                 # threshold for highlighting complex functions
		ratchet:
			enabled: true
			target: 0.0               # drive towards zero over-threshold functions
	pylint:
		enabled: true
		ratchet:
			enabled: true
			target: 9.5               # enforce a minimum pylint score
```

`timeout_seconds` and `xml_timeout_seconds` are especially helpful when running against large or flaky suites—timeouts surface as explicit tool errors instead of hanging the overall pipeline. Set `enabled: false` on any entry to skip that tool entirely.

Ratchets let teams make incremental progress toward ambitious targets without blocking every run: when enabled, a tool run succeeds if it reaches the configured target or improves upon the repository's best historical result. Once the target is achieved, CI enforces it strictly—new commits must stay at or beyond the goal (for example, no reduction in coverage or increase in cyclomatic complexity).

Each tool ships with sensible defaults for the tracked metric (`percentage` for coverage, `score` for Pylint, `summary.above_threshold` for Lizard) and the comparison direction (`higher` or `lower`). Override `metric`, `direction`, or `tolerance` inside the `ratchet` block if you need custom behavior.

## Usage

### CLI

Start the service:

```bash
full-auto-ci service start
```

The command launches the service in a background process, prints the dashboard URL (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` unless overridden via `dashboard.host`/`dashboard.port` in `~/.fullautoci/config.yml`), and—when possible—opens it in your default browser. A PID file is stored under the Full Auto CI data directory (`service.pid`) so you can inspect or stop the process later. Disable the auto-open behavior by setting `dashboard.auto_open: false` in your config or by exporting `FULL_AUTO_CI_OPEN_BROWSER=0`.

Check the status:

```bash
full-auto-ci service status
```

Stop the service:

```bash
full-auto-ci service stop
```

Add a repository:

```bash
full-auto-ci repo add "My Project" https://github.com/username/project.git
```

List repositories:

```bash
full-auto-ci repo list
```

Run tests manually:

```bash
full-auto-ci test run <repo_id> <commit_hash>
```

Show stored test results (optionally filtered by commit):

```bash
full-auto-ci test results <repo_id> [--commit <commit_hash>]
```

Each run captures the outputs from the enabled tools (Pylint, Coverage, Lizard by default). The CLI surfaces summarized findings—coverage percentage and per-file stats, pylint issue counts, and the top complexity offenders reported by Lizard.

### REST API

Start the API server (after installing API dependencies):

```bash
python -m src.api
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

See the [design document](design.md) for API endpoints.

## Development

### Using VS Code Dev Container (Recommended)

This project includes a VS Code Dev Container configuration for easy setup:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) VS Code extension
3. Open the project folder in VS Code
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" (or use the command palette: "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container")
5. The container will build and your development environment will be ready to use

### Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use containers:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[api,dashboard,dev]"
```

### Running the dashboard

The Flask-powered dashboard provides a quick status view of repositories and recent test runs:

```bash
python -m src.dashboard
```

By default the dashboard listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Configure host/port in `~/.fullautoci/config.yml` under the `dashboard` section.

### Dogfooding the project

The dev container initialization script automatically registers this repository so the service can test itself. To customise:

- `FULL_AUTO_CI_DOGFOOD=0` — skip registration
- `FULL_AUTO_CI_REPO_URL` — override repository URL
- `FULL_AUTO_CI_REPO_BRANCH` — override branch (default `main`)
- `FULL_AUTO_CI_REPO_NAME` — change display name

You can also enable always-on dogfooding directly from configuration by setting the `dogfood` section either in `~/.fullautoci/config.yml` or via the dev container config:

```yaml
dogfood:
	enabled: true
	name: "Full Auto CI"
	url: "https://github.com/calvinloveland/full-auto-ci.git"
	branch: "main"
	queue_on_start: true  # queue the latest commit immediately
```

When enabled, the service will ensure the repository is registered on startup and automatically queue the latest commit for testing unless `queue_on_start` is set to `false` (or `FULL_AUTO_CI_DOGFOOD_QUEUE=0`).

Set these variables before starting the container or rerun `.devcontainer/init_dev_env.sh` after adjusting them.

### Run tests

```bash
pytest
```

With coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

### UI tests (Playwright)

Install the development extras (includes Playwright and fixtures) and the Chromium engine:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dashboard,dev]"
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

Run the UI smoke tests:

```bash
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 pytest ui_tests
```

The fixture starts the dashboard in headless mode with `FULL_AUTO_CI_OPEN_BROWSER=0` and `FULL_AUTO_CI_START_DASHBOARD=1`. Override the default host/port via `ui_tests/conftest.py` if you need to avoid local conflicts.

### MCP server endpoint

Expose the CI service over the Model Context Protocol using the built-in JSON-RPC server:

```bash
full-auto-ci mcp serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

Provide an auth token either via `--token` or the `FULL_AUTO_CI_MCP_TOKEN` environment variable. Disable authentication explicitly with `--no-token` for local experiments.

Available operations:

- `handshake` — discover server name, version, and capabilities.
- `listRepositories` — enumerate tracked repositories (`id`, `name`, `url`, `branch`).
- `queueTestRun` — enqueue a repository/commit pair for testing.
- `getLatestResults` — retrieve recent test runs (with tool outputs) for a repository.

The server speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over newline-delimited TCP frames. Each request/response is a single JSON object encoded with UTF-8 and terminated by `\n`.

See `examples/mcp_client.py` for a minimal asyncio client that performs a handshake and lists repositories.

### Code style

This project follows PEP 8 style guide. You can check your code with:

```bash
pylint src/ tests/
```
