## Acceptable Duplication

### Test file setup patterns
- Various test files share similar setup/assertion patterns
- This is acceptable for test isolation and readability
- Consider pytest fixtures if patterns grow

### devcontainer.json settings
- Each project has similar VS Code configuration
- Acceptable as projects may need different settings
- Could template if more projects added

### calnix rebuild.sh
- Repeated command patterns within shell script
- Acceptable for shell script clarity

### full-auto-ci provider initialization
- Similar init patterns in bamboo.py/jenkins.py (9 lines)
- Acceptable as providers may diverge in future
