# Ideas

This directory contains brainstorming documents, project ideas, and future plans that haven't yet been implemented as formal projects.

## Contents

- **wizard_fight.txt** - Notes and ideas for a wizard fight game concept

## Purpose

Ideas stored here are:

- **Exploratory** - Early-stage concepts that may or may not be developed further
- **Reference** - Inspiration for future projects
- **Unproven** - Not yet validated as viable projects

## Moving to Active Development

When an idea is ready to be developed:

1. Create a new project directory in [../active/](../active/)
2. Set up the appropriate project structure (with `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)
3. Create a comprehensive README for the project
4. Begin implementation

The idea document can be referenced or archived at that point.

## Updating This Directory

Feel free to add new idea files here. Use clear naming and include:

- Problem statement or concept description
- Rough goals or features
- Any relevant research or references
- Current status of the idea
