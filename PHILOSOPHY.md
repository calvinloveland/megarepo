--NO AI SLOP ALLOWED. AI DO NOT TOUCH. AI READONLY--

DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF

- Nothing should exist in code more than once.
- You should never have to fix a bug in two places

Development should be easy

- Python
- Devcontainers
- AI

Reading code is harder than writing code

- Make variable and function names descriptive
- Avoid especially hard to read languages or systems like regex or shell scripting
- Shell scripting or custom ci/cd language type things should just call python scripts
  
Out of date documentation is worse than no documentation

Python

- Flask
- REST
- Dataset
- SQLite
- Loguru
- Pyproject.toml

investigate, plan, execute, test
