--NO AI SLOP ALLOWED. AI DO NOT TOUCH. AI READONLY--

DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF
- Nothing should exist in code more than once.
- You should never have to fix a bug in two places

Development should be easy
- Python
- Devcontainers
- AI

Reading code is harder than writing code
- Make variable and function names descriptive
- Avoid especially hard to read languages or systems like regex or shell scripting

Out of date documentation is worse than no documentation

Python
- Flask
- REST
- Dataset
- SQLite
- Loguru
