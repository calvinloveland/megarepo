These projects are archived primarily for reference. New development should go in the `active/` directory. If you need to revive or refactor an archived project, consider moving it to `active/` with an updated README and fresh setup instructions.

See [PHILOSOPHY.md](../PHILOSOPHY.md) for the repository's development philosophy.
